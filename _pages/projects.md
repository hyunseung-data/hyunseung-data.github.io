## Academic Projects


### Comparison of Discrete Choice Models  
*Course: Studies in Quantitative Marketing Decision Making*

Compared substitution patterns across Conditional Logit, Nested Logit, and Mixed Logit models using Nevo’s cereal dataset. Evaluated how relaxing the IIA assumption affects estimated elasticities and market share responses.

**Methods**: Conditional Logit, Nested Logit, Mixed Logit, Elasticity Analysis, pyblp
📌 Code files to be added
