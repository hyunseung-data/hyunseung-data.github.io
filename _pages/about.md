I am a graduate student in **Economics at Seoul National University**, advised by [Prof. Jungmin Lee](https://sites.google.com/view/jungminlee). My research focuses on **causal inference**, **labor economics**, and **data-driven policy evaluation**.

Before returning to academia, I spent **3 years at Viva Republica (Toss)**—Korea's leading fintech unicorn valued at $7B+—where I evolved from **Data Analyst** to **Data Product Manager**. There, I applied machine learning and causal inference methods to drive product decisions as Toss expanded into a financial super-app serving **20M+ users**.

## Research Interests

My work sits at the intersection of **economics** and **data science**:

- **Causal Inference & Machine Learning**: Difference-in-Differences, Causal Forest, Double ML
- **Labor Economics**: Minimum wage policy, labor reallocation, gender wage gaps
- **Applied Microeconometrics**: Policy evaluation with large-scale administrative data
- **Product Analytics**: A/B testing, engagement metrics, causal attribution

## Current Research

**Reallocation Channel of a Minimum-Wage Shock** *(with Prof. Jungmin Lee)*
> Analyzing labor reallocation following Korea's 30%+ minimum wage increase using 300M+ employer-employee matched administrative records. Employing DiD methodology to identify how regional business cycles moderate employment and reallocation effects.

**Family-Friendly Firms and the Motherhood Penalty** *(with Tammy Lee & Prof. Jungmin Lee)*
> Investigating how workplace flexibility mitigates the motherhood penalty using causal forest models for heterogeneous treatment effect estimation.

## Why Data Science M.S.?

I'm seeking to deepen my expertise in **computational methods for causal inference** at a top U.S. graduate program. My goal is to bridge rigorous econometric methods with scalable machine learning approaches—contributing to both academic research and real-world decision-making.
