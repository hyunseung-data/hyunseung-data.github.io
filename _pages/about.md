I am a first-year M.A. student in Economics at **Seoul National University**, advised by [Prof. Jungmin Lee](https://sites.google.com/view/jungminlee). 

My research interests lie in **causal inference**, **labor economics**, and **applied microeconometrics**. I am particularly interested in using large-scale administrative data to study labor market dynamics and policy effects.

Before graduate school, I worked as a **Data Analyst** and **Data Product Manager** at [Toss](https://toss.im) (Viva Republica), Korea's leading fintech company, where I applied causal inference methods to product analytics.

I am currently seeking **Data Science M.S. programs** for Fall 2026.
