## Working Papers

### Reallocation Channel of a Minimum-Wage Shock
**with Prof. Jungmin Lee** (Seoul National University)

This paper investigates the labor reallocation dynamics following South Korea's substantial minimum wage increases (2017–2019), which raised the hourly minimum by over **30% cumulatively**.

**Data**: Korea's employer–employee matched administrative data spanning 2015–2020 (**300+ million observations**)

**Methodology**: 
- Difference-in-Differences exploiting geographic variation in minimum wage exposure
- Event study design for dynamic treatment effects
- Heterogeneity analysis by regional labor market conditions

**Key Findings**:
- Regional business cycle conditions significantly moderate both employment effects and reallocation patterns
- Labor market tightness plays a crucial role in how minimum wage policies transmit through the economy

## Ongoing Projects

### Family-Friendly Firms and the Motherhood Penalty
**with Tammy Lee & Prof. Jungmin Lee** (Seoul National University)

The motherhood penalty—the earnings and career disadvantages experienced by mothers—remains persistent across labor markets. This project examines whether firm-level family-friendly policies can mitigate these penalties.

**Research Questions**:
1. How do flexible work arrangements affect mothers' career trajectories?
2. Do on-site childcare facilities reduce the wage gap?
3. What role does remote work play post-pandemic?

**Methodology**: 
- **Causal Forest** for heterogeneous treatment effect estimation
- Machine learning for high-dimensional covariate adjustment
- Matched employer-employee administrative data

## Research Statement

> My goal is to bridge the gap between **rigorous causal inference** and **scalable data science methods**. I believe the most impactful research combines deep theoretical understanding with modern computational tools.
>
> As I pursue graduate studies in Data Science, I aim to develop methodologies that make causal inference more accessible and applicable to large-scale, complex datasets—contributing to evidence-based policymaking and business decision-making.
