## Working Papers & Ongoing Projects

### Reallocation Channel of a Minimum-Wage Shock
**with Prof. Jungmin Lee**  
*Nov 2024 – Present*

Using employer–employee matched administrative data from Statistics Korea (2015–2020), this project examines how minimum wage increases trigger labor reallocation toward higher-paying, more productive, and more stable firms.  
I further study how **regional business cycles** moderate both employment adjustments and reallocation, identifying local labor demand conditions as a key mechanism behind minimum-wage effects.

### Family-Friendly Firms and the Motherhood Penalty
**with Tammy Lee and Prof. Jungmin Lee**  
*Nov 2023 – Present*

This project explores how “family-friendly” firm policies, such as flexible hours, on-site childcare, and remote-work options, mitigate the motherhood penalty in employment and earnings.  
I apply **causal forest models** (Athey et al., 2019) to estimate heterogeneous treatment effects across firms and worker types.
