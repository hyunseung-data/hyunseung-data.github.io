Hi, I am **Hyunseung Lee**, an M.A. student in Economics at **Seoul National University** advised by Prof. Jungmin Lee.  
I am interested in **labor economics**, **minimum wage policy**, and **data-driven policy evaluation**, using large-scale administrative data and causal inference methods.

I previously worked as a **Data Analyst and Data Product Manager** at Viva Republica (Toss), where I led data-driven product initiatives as the company expanded toward a financial super app.

## Research

- **Reallocation Channel of a Minimum-Wage Shock**  
  *with Prof. Jungmin Lee*  
  Using nationwide employer–employee matched data (2015–2020, 300M+ obs), this project studies how minimum wage increases reallocate workers toward higher-paying, more productive, and more stable firms, and how these effects vary across regional business cycles.

- **Family-Friendly Firms and the Motherhood Penalty**  
  *with Tammy Lee and Prof. Jungmin Lee*

## Selected Data & Analytics Projects

- **DiD-inspired Engagement Metric at Toss**  
  Designed a Difference-in-Differences–inspired engagement metric to measure each service’s causal contribution to total app usage, deployed via company-wide dashboards for strategic decision-making.

- **Forecasting Inflation with Deep Learning**  
  Built a VAR and Bayesian LSTM model to forecast inflation, combining macroeconomic time series with uncertainty-aware deep learning.
